# Penetration Test - Assignment

## Introduction

**Juice Shop** is aiming to be the next big thing in online juice shopping.

The company behind has hired youðŸ«µ to make a penetration test on their site.

Their two main concerns.
The first is damage to reputation, as they're aiming to position
themselves as brand that consumers can trust.
The other is direct financial loss.

## Getting started

Before you begin on the assignment, you need to set up a lab environment.

The easiest way is with [docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started/).

You can find the docker image for juice-shop [here](https://hub.docker.com/r/bkimminich/juice-shop).

The application has a score board built-in that tracks your progress.
First challenge is to find the scoreboard.

## What you need to do

Your task is to find and document security vulnerabilities.

It is a good idea to keep a sitemap as you move along.
A sitemap is a listing of all sub-pages you find.

You need to document your findings in a small report that you hand-in.

Your report should include the following for each vulnerability you find:

- **Sitemap** list of sub-pages you evaluated
- **Identification** number or short name for the vulnerability
- **Severity** rate the severity of the vulnerability. You are free to invent
  your own system, but it must be documented.
- **Description** What is the vulnerability. How did you find it. Steps to exploit.

The report MUST be handed in as PDF (upload on moodle).

## Scope

In a real world penetration test, the goal is to be as thorough as possible.

The Juice Shop application has a lot of vulnerabilities of increasingly difficulty.
It would be unrealistic for you cover them all.

So for this assignment I would expect you to cover between 8-16 vulnerabilities.
Feel free to cover more.

## Tools

Install [Burp Suite Community Edition](https://portswigger.net/burp/communitydownload).

1. Start a temporary project and use default configuration
2. Click on "Proxy" tab
3. Click "Open browser" button and navigate to juice-shop
4. You can use the "Intercept is off" button to turn interception on, so you
   can tamper with requests
