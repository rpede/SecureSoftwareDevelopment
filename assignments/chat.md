# Mini Project

## Intro

Implement a chat/messaging application with focus on confidentiality and
integrity (security goals from CIA triad).

Given that you just learned about cryptography you should put your new gained
knowledge to use.

## Scope

Your solution should allow two-people to communicate with each other without the
risk of eavesdropping.
Group chats, where more than two people send/receive messages at a time, is out scope.

**Bonus** if your application allows for near real-time communication.
It can be achieved with WebSocket, socket.io, SignalR, TCP-socket, using a
message queue or so on.

I don't expect the UI to look fancy.
A simple unstyled HTML page, plain GUI or CLI/TUI is fine.
The only requirement regarding UI is that it should be obvious how to use it.

## Hand-in

You must hand-in a link to git repository with your code before deadline.
The repository must be public.

The repository must have a `README.md` in the root containing instructions on how to run the solution.
It also needs to describe how you use cryptography to prevent eavesdropping.

Please include screenshots of you solution in action.
