# Cyber Resilience Act

## Introduction

By now you should have a high level of understanding of what Cyber Resilience
Act (CRA) is about.

Businesses are starting to look into how they can conform, so a lot of
information targeted management is starting to emerge.
However, much of the practical work falls on us technical professionals.
And as proud craftsmen, we want to be capable thereof.

So, how will the CRA actually impact us as software developers?
That's the questions you'll explore in this exercise.

## Task

- Form a group (up to 4 students).
- Create a digital pamphlet targeted software developers.
- The goal is to give practical advice on how developers can contribute to
their organizationâ€™s CRA compliance efforts.
- You don't have to cover all of CRA. Instead, you can go deeper into some
requirements if you want.
- Include suitable infographics.
  - You are not required to magically transform into a graphic designer.
  - Focus on clarity and usefulness, not perfection.
  - Be creative!

## Guidelines

- You need to conduct additional research beyond what's covered in class.
- Copy-pasting from ChatGPT or other sources is not enough.
- You are encouraged to discuss ideas with the teacher and get feedback along
the way.

## Presentation

Each group will give a short presentation of their work during the next lesson.
